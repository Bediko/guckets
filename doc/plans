SOME POSSIBLE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE

Change the level language back to Lua.

Maybe base FE/BE communication on callbacks, thereby introducing a
"Middle End".

Add many kinds of callbacks usable by levels. Time isn't necessary though...
I don't think levels should use this. (Feel free to prove me wrong.) But well,
there was a reason to introduce these advanced scripting capabilities..!
So we could use a callback that's called on every change in the level (or just
changes to a specific bucket). Provide level-wide data storage (if possible,
by just doing "my $foo;" at the top level).

MANY MANY more levels, probably some using scripting. And also provide many
more levels without scripting. Guckets isn't THAT kind of game that would just
be plain boring without scripting (at least I can't think of any really cool
and big stuff realised with scripts) but there's no reason not to provide it.
(And after all, this scripting stuff saves me from writing or using a parser
for level files... :D)

Reintroduce Level 6, should its author ever awake from IRC coma (GPL -> WTPFL).

Possibly write a game guide, showing some solutions and/or tricks for the
levels. (The part with the tricks sound very nice, like, guide how to solve
levels more quickly - and it might be real fun to think about it.. whether
there are actually methods that can be used on this kind of game... :-))
